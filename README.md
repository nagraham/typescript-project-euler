# Project Euler Solutions in TypeScript

### Why

I'm in the process learning TypeScript, es2015 style JavaScript, Jasmine, and generally knocking the rust off my brittle JavaScript skills. Project Euler is a source of challenging, bite-sized problems. I've already solved some of these problems in other languages; it's fun to revisit these problems with new solutions in a new language.

### What

The solutions are in the _src/solutions_ directory. They are typically composed of reusable components, found in the _src/lib/_ directory.
