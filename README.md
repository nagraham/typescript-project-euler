# Project Euler Solutions in TypeScript

### Why

To knock the rust off my JavaScript skill, and learn TypeScript, Jasmine, and possibly some other tools. Project Euler provides a big source of challenging, bite-sized problems to work on. I've already solved some of these problems in other languages, but its fun to revisit them with a new language. 

### What

The solutions are in the _src/solutions_ directory. They are typically composed of reusable components, found in the _src/lib/_ directory.
